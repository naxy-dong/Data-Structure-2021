# Data-Structure-HW4
The last data structure project involving a simulation of passengers in a boarding queue on a plane. This project heavily depend on random events and it would print out events happening in each minute of the simulation, I implemented boarding queue as a priority queue using heap data structure for more efficient enqueue and dequeue methods.
